            <p class="bio">Hi! My name is Matt LaTendresse I am a junior at the University of Kansas. I study computer science because I think it's very fun and I have always been interested in computers! I'm from Overland Park, Kansas and went to Blue Valley Northwest for highschool. 
                I'm very bad at writing about myself so I'm just going to start naming things that I enjoy. I really enjoy going out with friends and having a lot of fun when I am not doing school stuff. My biggest red flag is that 
                I have been in two musicals here at KU.
